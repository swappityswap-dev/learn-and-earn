Polkadot is a blockchain protocol and network that incorporates multiple blockchains, **parachains**, connected into one major blockchain, the **relay chain**. Parchains are specialized for particular purposes, and each handle their own parallel stream of transactions, while exchanging data with each other and the relay chain. The relay chain provides a layer of security for itself and all the parachains. 

Polkadot is known as a "sharded multichain network", where the parachains are the shards. Parralel processing power generated by the parachains leads to higher scalability than other single chain blockchains like Bitcoin.  Different parachains can specialize in different transaction types and optimized for certain use cases, like Identity, supply chain, or file storage. Optimizing around a certain use case leaves out unnecessary code and improves efficiency and security.

Polkadot lets developers build parachains using the **substrate framework**.

## To better understand these terms, it is necessary to talk about how polkadot works:

### Polkadot leverages four main components to achieve its goals:

* Relay chain

* Parachains

* Parathreads

* Bridges

### The relay chain

The heart of Polkadot, responsible for shared security, consensus and interoperability between chains on the network. Polkadot uses Relay Chain primarily to verify transactions, similar to how Bitcoin and Ethereum use the Proof of Work and Proof of Stake (POS) processes to verify transactions. At Polkadot, users can stake the native DOT token to aid in the work of transaction verification.
As the main component of the polkadot ecosystem this is the list of functions of the Relay Chain includes:

* Validation of transactions.

* Nomination of the parties that will bet their coins for validation.

* Preservation of historical data.

* Health monitoring of the entire Polkadot system.

### Parachain

is a complete blockchain application that lives on top of the Relay Chain. It is described by Polkadot in his whitepaper as "an application-specific data structure that is globally consistent and validatable."
Parachain is similar to other blockchain networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum Blockchain. Polkadot is unique in that it can contain multiple blockchains within itself. Hypothetically, you can house both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains within itself and place each as a Parachain.

### Parathreads

Parathreads are temporary spaces in the Polkadot network, used primarily for testing ideas.
Parathreads are similar to Parachains in that they allow the construction of a blockchain or special use application.

### Bridges

Bridges, or the ability of an individual blockchain to communicate and transfer value to another, have been absent in traditional blockchain technology.
Let's say you want to buy an NFT priced in ETH, but you only have BTC. Traditionally, you would have to convert BTC to fiat and then convert it to ETH, or buy ETH for BTC on an exchange. You simply cannot transfer value or data from one Blockchain to the other without an intermediate layer, be it an exchange or fiat.
Bridges change that restriction, and allow Parachains, which are essentially blockchains embedded within the Polkadot ecosystem, to communicate and share data.The economic sovereignty and diversity of the respective blockchains are not affected when communicating or transacting through the bridges.

## The polkadot token (DOT)

Polkadot uses its native token, DOT, for payments, transaction processing and governance. DOT is also used for PoS (Proof of Stake) relay chain validation.
The DOT token performs multiple functions on the Polkadot network, such as compensating validators, as a government token, or as a currency.

## The DOT token has several characteristics

Users with DOT tokens have governance rights over the platform. Allows to determine network rates, vote on proposed network updates and allow parachains to be deployed or deleted
Designed to facilitate consensus on the network through staking. By leveraging the DOT tokens, it helps to maintain the security of the network, encouraging following the consensus
It has a binding function. This function is necessary for the addition of new parachains within the Polkadot network. When a bonding period is generated, the DOT tokens that have been attached are locked until the process ends

## What is the Polkadot consensus?

The consensus system called Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) has been developed. In many respects NPoS is the same as the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism with slight variations.
Within this mechanism, the validators must offer the infrastructure for the maintenance of the network. They have the task of producing the new blocks, the process of validating the parachain blocks and the security of the network. They must be available at all times and have the ability to run the infrastructure safely and reliably.

## Problems You Are Looking For, Polkadot Wants To Solve:

1. Scalability.


Most of the popular blockchains are not scalable due to their structure.
For example, long ago, it cost between a few cents and a few dollars equivalent to ETH to transact on Ethereum, the world's most popular blockchain. Today, Ethereum fees have cost more than $ 250

2. No or limited data communication and exchange.


Dozens of blockchains were created in isolation, and it is not possible for them to communicate or exchange value with each other. For example, you cannot send BTC on the ETH network.

3. Lack of customization.


Until the advent of Ethereum, blockchains did not support any customization of the transfer of value from one owner to another. Bitcoin, for example, only allowed peer-to-peer transactions. Smart Contracts allowed customizing and programming what can be achieved on a blockchain, to a limited extent.


4. Low energy impact validation mechanism.

A secure transaction validation mechanism is sought, at the same time that it does not require expensive hardware and high energy consumption
